            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p> When discussing genocides, the Armenian genocide is typically one of the first to be
            mentioned. However, few recall that Armenians were not the only group targeted for
            execution during World War I in the Ottoman Empire. Assyrians, another Christian ethnic
            group subjected to deportations and mass killings, form a small community in Germany that
            remains largely unseen and unheard. Why does their voice matter, and what steps have been
            taken to memorialize the victims? Using critical analysis of historical sources as well as
            accounts of Assyrian activists, the article highlights the significance of recognizing the
            Assyrian genocide in Germany as an ally of the Ottoman Empire in World War I while
            exposing the past denial of responsibility and prolonged reluctance to acknowledge it. The
            focus on the Ecumenical Memorial for Genocide Victims in Berlin, as an example of
            memorialization within the city’s landscape, offers valuable insights for scholars studying
            memorial culture and commemoration practices.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> A memorial in Berlin commemorates the victims of the Ottoman genocide, including Assyrians, raising questions about Germany’s historical role. As an ally of the Ottoman Empire, Germany bears a complex legacy of silence and complicity. The article explores Germany's past denial, Assyrian activism, and the significance of memorialization for diaspora identity.</p>

            <h2>Connection: Germany and the genocide during the First World War</h2>
            <p>Germany had extensive knowledge of the genocide through diplomats and missionaries like Johannes Lepsius but prioritized its alliance with the Ottoman Empire over intervention. Despite internal protests and documentation, German authorities censored reports and denied responsibility. Their inaction underscores the dominance of realpolitik over moral duty.</p>

            <h2>Assyrian immigration to Germany</h2>
            <p>Assyrians began migrating to Germany in the 1960s as laborers and refugees fleeing persecution in Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. Over time, a sizable diaspora formed, integrating into German society but facing the risk of cultural assimilation. Collective memory of genocide became vital for preserving Assyrian identity across generations.</p>

            <h2>Genocide recognition</h2>
            <p>Despite internal divisions, the Assyrian diaspora in Germany established a cultural presence and collaborated with Armenians to advocate for recognition of the 1915 genocide. In 2016, the German Bundestag officially acknowledged the genocide, including the Assyrian victims, despite political backlash from Turkey. This recognition was a major milestone for the Assyrian community, long overshadowed in public discourse.</p>

            <h2>Memorialization: Ecumenical Memorial for Genocide Victims in the Ottoman Empire</h2>
            <p>An interethnic group created a shared memorial in a Berlin cemetery in 2012 to honor Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian victims. The site includes symbolic altars and plaques listing massacred villages, designed to foster remembrance and education. However, its marginal location limits public engagement, reflecting broader patterns of selective memory in German commemorative culture.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Germany’s delayed recognition highlights how political interests often outweigh historical accountability. For the Assyrian diaspora, remembrance and recognition are crucial to preserving identity amid assimilation pressures. Academic research continues to grow, though it remains entangled with identity politics and the need for objective historical analysis.</p>
