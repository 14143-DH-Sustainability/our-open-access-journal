    <h1>Translation of the poem على هذه الأرض by Mahmoud Darwish</h1>

    <p>
        On this earth<br>
There are things worth living for<br> on this earth:<br> April comes and goes,<br>
the smell of bread at dawn,<br> the opinions of a woman about men<br>
about men,<br> the writings of Aeschylus,<br> the beginning of love,<br>
Grass on a stone,<br> mothers standing on a flute melody,<br>
the invaders' fear because of memories.<br>

    </p>

    <p>
        There is life worth living on this earth:<br> at the end of September, a
lady enters the forties with full splendor,<br> the hour of the sun in prison,<br>
clouds imitating a procession of creatures,<br> applause from the people for those
who ascend smiling to their deaths,<br> fear of the tyrants
of the people's songs.<br>

    </p>

    <p>
        On this earth there is life worth living:<br> On this earth,
        the lady of all earths, mother of all beginnings, mother of all endings.<br>
        She was once called Palestine.<br> She is now called Palestine.<br>
        Oh my lady:<br> I deserve, because you are my lady,<br>
        I deserve life.<br>
