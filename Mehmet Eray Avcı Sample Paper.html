    <h3> Literal Translation of the Text: n</h3>
    <p> My Fortunate Son Sultan Majesty,
Prior to three days after writing to you, as we are sheikh figures, some matters are heard during
your deliberations. You were either going to or coming from Baghdad, and given the warrant of
Hüdai and accepted it. In the morning, being offended and still expressing his resentment to your
side. Now that this issue is recognized by you, and those who are in the head of the power are
those who do not like you. Eventually, there is absolutely and certainly nothing bad about you in
the sight of Almighty Allah both apparently and in knowledge, but, to dispel the doubts, this
paper is written. Make yourself known to the people, stay for some more time, as nothing is
necessary from this precaution. And, do not completely abandon caution. For instance, with
plenty of impressions, with affairs, an usher might come to you, not with one or two persons but
plenty, then it would be good if you don't abandon caution, but excessive caution beyond this is
not necessary. My Majesty My Son, do not ever be in doubt about what I have written. But the
reason for my writing is that I had said there was no problem in going to Chania. Now, after
hearing your horse story, my opinion has been expressed to your side.
The Evidently Right One, One From Üsküdar, In Şaban.: [...]</p>

    <h3> Textual Analysis: </h3>
    <p> By the mentioning of “Berat-ı Hüdâyi” in the text, and the mark of the sender as “ Al-
Üsküdârî”, it can be understood that this text was written by Aziz Mahmud Hüdayi, a Sufi tariqat
order’s founder. Hüdayi was born in a town that is currently located in today’s Ankara in 1541,
and moved to Istanbul in his early ages to study at the madrasa of Küçük Ayasofya. After his
education, he traveled across the regions of Bursa, Damascus, Egypt and Balkans. He engaged
with many Sufi Tariqat orders, became a sheikh, and indoctrinated people according to Sufi
Islam values. He built his very own dervish lodge (dergah) in Üsküdar in the year 1595, at the
age of 54. He was an important figure in his time, he gave the first khutbah in the Sultan Ahmed
Mosque in 1616 during its opening, and he was married to Süleyman The Magnificent’s grand
daughter. He was in contact with couple of Sultans during his lifetime through visits and letters,
such as Sultan Murat III, Sultan Ahmed I, Sultan Osman II and Sultan Murat IV. He even
attended to the conquest of Tabriz by Ottoman Army per invitation in 1585. Evliya Çelebi, a
renowned Ottoman traveller and author mentions that 7 Sultans had kissed Hüdayi’s hand in a
manner of respect, and he had around 170 000 followers in his order. His own dergah was
considered as one of the most sublime places of sufism in Istanbul and his influence went beyond
Istanbul, across various regions, from Balkans to Baghdad. Indicating hisself as “musarrah”/the 1
evidently right one and “üsküdârî” at the bottom of the text shows the importance and respect he
gained, as these high valued titles are matched with him. (Hüdayi, his most known title, also has
the lexical meaning of “the one who has been guided to the right path.”) Moreover, as mentioned
in the text, his authority to give the warrant of “berât-ı hüdâyî”, in his name, shows the power he
held, and emphasizes the value and respect that is attached to him. By reviewing the context of
the letter, and the elkab section (the part which the titles and adjectives of the addressee is listed)
it can be said that Aziz Mahmud Hüdayi actually knows the recipient and has a relationship with
him, most likely as a Sufi sheikh - follower relationship. His tone in the letter is both advisory
and highly respectful, which might imply that the addressee is also an important high ranking
political figure of that time, who was at a expedition to Baghdad or near Baghdad. The
mentioning of a possibility of a visit from usher with affairs and Hüdayi’s advice to make
himself seen more to the people also suggests this inference. Hüdayi mentions that since he is in
a sheikh position, he has the ability to hear about rumors that exist, and when finds out about the
problems and struggles the addressee is having, he decides to write this letter to guide and
enlighten him. In his advises, he emphasizes the importance of caution that should be taken.
However, he also comforts the addressee, and does that with also mentioning Allah’s name,
which adds sublime authenticity and spiritual reassurance to the text, and tries to make the
addressee feel safe and confident, without any doubts. While ending his letter, Hüdayi gives
permission for addressee to take the trip to Chania, a coastal city in today’s Greece, in Crete
island. This sentence and letter as a whole is another example of the crucial role Sufi Sheiks
played in the Classical Ottoman Era in governing and decision-making. Just as Hüdayi’s other 2
letters in the Ottoman archives that were written to Sultans, this letter shows how Hüdayi has the
authority to take part in managing crucial emergencies and struggles, through his “wisdom” and
“divine power.” [...]</p>
