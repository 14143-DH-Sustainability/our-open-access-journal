      <h2>Abstract of the presentation</h2>
      <p>
        Since I am presenting the project of a university seminar paper I am
        currently working on, it might be that not everything is already cristal
        clear to me since I am „in the process“ of writing and could be that I
        will change some details and aspects of this project. But, on the other
        side, I hope that presenting my topic and discussing it with the other
        participants will help me in this process of writing the paper on this
        topic. As I mentioned in the first abstract, my topic will be „tourism
        in Weimar Republic“, especially I want to deal with Berlin, that became
        a very popular tourism destination in these years. I dismissed my idea
        of comparing travel books with personal/individual ego-documents like
        travel reports and diaries. After speaking with my professor about the
        topic and the central problem of my paper we worked out another
        approach: Now my main focus will be the narrative or „myth“ of the „wild
        Berlin of the Twenties“. My first rough hypothesis is that this image of
        the „wild Berlin“ was, to a big part, shaped by the tourism industry oft
        he time and travel literature as an essential part of this industry. The
        sources remain mostly the same as mentioned in the first abstract: To
        answer my question I am currently studying three travel books from this
        era: Alfred Heilborn’s: Die Reise nach Berlin (1925) Eugen Szatmari’s
        Was nicht im Baedeker steht. Das Buch von Berlin (1927), Curt Moreck’s
        Ein Führer durch das lasterhafte Berlin (A Guide to depraved Berlin)
        (1931). As one can see in the title of the second book by Szatmari, it’s
        main goal is to seperate itself from the main (and, quite important,
        mainSTREAM!) travel book of this time, the famous Badaeker. So, the main
        points of my presentation will be introducing the audience tot he
        historical context: What were the changes that Berlin and Germany faced
        after World War I? How and why Berlin became such an important tourist
        attraction? Afterwards I gonna talk about the travel literature of that
        time in general, especially about the role of the Bedaeker travel books.
        Afterwards I want to speak about these three „alternative“ travel books
        on Berlin and try to answer the main hypothesis with these examples of
        travel literature oft he 1920s/ beginning of the 1930s.
