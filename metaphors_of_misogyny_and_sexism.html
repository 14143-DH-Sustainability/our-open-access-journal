    <h1>Summary of Thesis</h1>

    <h2>1. Thesis Statement</h2>
    <p>This paper investigates metaphorical uses of the terms “misogyny” and “sexism” in US public discourse using the COCA corpus. It hypothesises that both are framed negatively, especially through metaphors of violence and crime.</p>

    <h2>2. Theoretical Framework</h2>
    <p>Metaphors offer insight into social ideologies and help make abstract concepts like misogyny and sexism more tangible, though identifying them in a corpus poses challenges.</p>

    <h2>3. Language Data and Method of Analysis</h2>
    <p>The study uses a sample of 200 concordances for each term from COCA, manually identifying and analysing metaphorical patterns with help from Stefanowitsch’s methods due to the corpus’s lack of metaphor annotation.</p>

    <h2>4. Analysis and Discussion of the Results</h2>
    <p>From the selected data, both “misogyny” and “sexism” showed frequent metaphorical use, particularly framed as a living creature or a crime.</p>

    <h3>4.1 MISOGYNY</h3>
    <p>92 out of 200 concordances were metaphorical, with “MISOGYNY IS A LIVING CREATURE” (38 occurrences) and “MISOGYNY IS CRIME” (13) being the most frequent.</p>

    <h4>4.1.1 MISOGYNY IS A LIVING CREATURE</h4>
    <p>This was the most creative and dominant metaphor, often evoking violent or oppressive imagery, depicting misogyny as a harmful force.</p>

    <h4>4.1.2 MISOGYNY IS CRIME</h4>
    <p>Though less frequent, this metaphor was more conventional and consistently linked misogyny to legal terminology, reinforcing its perceived severity.</p>

    <h3>4.2 SEXISM</h3>
    <p>Sexism showed 109 metaphorical uses, with similar conceptual metaphors to misogyny but slightly more negative in tone.</p>

    <h4>4.2.1 SEXISM IS A LIVING CREATURE</h4>
    <p>This metaphor appeared 48 times, and more of its realisations were negatively connoted than in the misogyny sample, indicating a more hostile view of sexism.</p>

    <h4>4.2.2 SEXISM IS CRIME</h4>
    <p>Appearing with legal language like “charges of,” this metaphor portrayed sexism as a serious and punishable offense, even more gravely than misogyny.</p>

    <h2>5. Conclusion and Ideas for Further Research</h2>
    <p>Overall, both terms are metaphorically conceptualised as violent, oppressive, and criminal. However, sexism appears to carry slightly stronger negative associations than misogyny. Future studies could broaden the sample or compare findings across different linguistic and cultural contexts.</p>
